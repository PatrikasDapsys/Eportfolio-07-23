Welcome to my personal e-portfolio website! This website is built using React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion to create an engaging and interactive experience.
I have implemented several exciting features to enhance the user's browsing experience.

### Features
#### Mouse Tracker
One of the unique aspects of my portfolio website is the mouse tracker. I have incorporated a dynamic mouse tracking effect that follows the user's cursor as they navigate the website.
This adds a visually appealing and interactive element to the overall design.

#### Carousel
To showcase my projects and experiences effectively, I have integrated a carousel component.
This allows visitors to scroll through and explore my various works or achievements seamlessly.
The carousel provides a user-friendly way to browse through the content, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience.

#### Dark and Light Modes
I understand the importance of accessibility and personal preference, so I have included dark and light mode options.
Users can easily switch between the two modes, depending on their preferences and needs.
The dark mode provides a visually pleasing experience, especially in low-light environments, while the light mode ensures readability and a clean aesthetic.

These features, combined with the power of React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, create an immersive and enjoyable browsing experience on my personal e-portfolio website.
Feel free to explore and get in touch with me through the provided contact information!
